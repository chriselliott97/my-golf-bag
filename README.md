### Goal 
- Buying the right golf clubs is never an easy thing to do whether you are new to the game of golf or not
- With My Golf App it allows for new or experienced golfers to create a golf bag and add clubs that are specific to them 
- Each bag will show the clubs that the user picks as well as any reviews that may be attached to each club 
- Each bag will show a total bag cost as well as a rating of the bag which is all to help the user get a feel for clubs they may want to buy in the future
